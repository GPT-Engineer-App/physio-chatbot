# physio-chatbot

Create a Web app that lets you chat with an AI agent that is an expert in physiotherapy. By explaining the problem and pointing at an image of a human body where the pain is located, the chatbot replies to narrow down on what is the reason for the pain, for example by asking additional questions, and finally recommends exercises to solve the issues. The agent should be able to gather this data automatically from relevant online sources, if necessary also by creating its own vector database with necessary information gathered from online sources such as Youtube.
